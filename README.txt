LABORATORY WORK
Firstly I downloaded the ubuntu linux, I deleted my windows and created a dual boot if I wanted to put again windows, as a second OS, after I instaled 
LINUX, I changed the memoriry for OS and then, I also put some free space for both OS. Afterr that I created an account on Linux, to access and maintain a 
high security. I opened terminal to update the package, and then with the comand {sudo apt install zsh -y) I instaled zsh as a command of the root. For oh-
my-zsh I used the following [sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"] after this I instaled a toolchain that 
will compile my code.  I created a program in C that will print "hello world''Also I instaled I created an acount to github from web, then I opened in 
terminal git, I created a repository, and added there a README file, the c program and a makefile also I added to this the screenshots. After this I had to 
generate a ssh key to be able to post everyhing.
